1303445;44;37;3;just remember, garfield, when we get to the farm you are there to relax. - i know last time you wanted to be helpful... - but you do not grow chickens by planting chickens in the ground! it was an hones mistake.;

1332945;28;23;3;tell me, garfield, when you walk, do your right and left legs travel together, or do you use your opposing legs? - - i'll never walk again.;
1332947;24;15;3;z z z i wonder how birds can sleep in trees without falling out. - z z z - z z z aha! ...hammocks.;

1332958;33;27;3;you know, doc, for brothers, we don't look much alike. - it's hard to believe we came from the same place. - you mean, the farm? the funny farm maybe.;

1332963;29;28;4;why do girls always so good, arlene? - we wear perfume. - sounds kind of sissified to me. - i get this from a sex that likes to tattoo themselves.;

1333058;36;30;3;garfield! look what you did to my chair! - i don't deserve this! - i was only gone for the evening. now i know the face. weren't you a former owner of mine?;
1333059;37;28;3;garfield, i know being a cat owner is a big responsibility. - but i should be able to leave for an evening without you destroying everything! - i want a divorce! i get half of everything.;

1333063;25;23;3;garfield, it's noon. are you getting out of bed? - i'd love to get up... - but the blanket is extra heavy today.;

1333069;19;16;3;it seems like an age since i gave odie a boot. - boot! - i'm just a sentimental fool.;
1333070;81;63;7;something's wrong. - hey, garfield! let's have some fun! forget it, jon. - i want to take you to an italian restaurant for a lasagna dinner. no way. - they have ferns for dessert. big deal. - then we can come home and i'll hold odie down while you beat him up. try and make me. - - how did you know we have an appointment at the vet's? i don't know. i just know.;

1333926;126;84;3;when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. away to the window i flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. what's a sash? - the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below. when, what to my wondering eyes should appear. but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. they look bigger on television. - with a little old driver, so lively and quick, i knew in a moment it must be st. nick. or maybe santa claus.;
1333927;134;82;3;more rapid than eagles his coursers they came. and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name "now, dasher! now, dancer! now, prancer and vixen! on, comet! on, cupid! on, donder and blitzen! on, dopey! on, sneezy! on, happy! - "to the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! now dash away! dash away! dash away all! can't they just walk anywhere? - as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, so up to the housetop the coursers, they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas, too. tune in tomorrow. the good part's coming.;
1333928;165;93;3;and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. as i drew in my head, and was turning around, down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound. oh, no! a chimney monster! - he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. you didn't break any toys did you? - his eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow he also has a well-rounded personality.;
1333929;169;99;3;the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth. and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed, like a bowiful of jelly. ho! ho! ho! a few sit-ups would take care of that, fella. - he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf. and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread. we must have lunch sometime. - he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose. and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose how did he do that?;
1333930;63;42;3;he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like to down of a thistle. but i heard him exclaim, are he drove out of sight, - happy christmas to all and to all a good night! what a nice guy, what a nice story. - have a happy and loving holiday season.;

1347127;33;18;3;i love attacking the mailman. some days i scratch him. some days i bite him. some days i trip him. - today i'm trying something new. * - i'm humiliating him.;
1347215;24;19;3;* - arrrgh! b-b-b-b - when he comes around, he'll thank me for breaking up the monotony of his dreary job.;
1347216;57;41;3;come on, mailman, deliver that mail. - and when you do, i'm going to leap on you and all that will be left will be your mailbag and that silly-looking hat of yours. - has the mailman come yet, garfield? no, he's still standing at the end of the sidewalk sobbing.;
1347217;20;19;3;slam! - rats! i missed him! - apparently, no one ever told him to look both ways before crossing the street. screech;
1347218;39;35;3;be a good boy and fetch the mail, garfield. oui, mon capitaine. - rip rowt clobber blap - did you hurt him bad? oh, just a few lacerations, abrasions and internal injuries. i was in a good mood.;
1347219;13;8;6;plop! - - glup! - ptoo ptoo - splut! - salvage the pride, garfield, salvage the pride.;
1347220;33;30;3;hey, garfield, it says here people can perform superhuman feats of strength during periods of great stress. - what baloney! - by the way, i'm taking you to the vet today.;
1347221;35;26;3;you can't hide from forever, garfield. i'm going to find you and take you to the vet. - you may be sneaky, but i'm sneakier. - "sneaky" is my middle name.;
1347222;40;34;3;garfield can't resist lasagna, and when he comes to eat it, i'm going to catch him and take him to the vet. - smack gulp slurp - that cat has the longest lips i've ever seen.;
1347223;34;28;3;now where could garfield be? - he's not in tie cookies, and he certainly won't be in the doggie biscuits. - poo! it's a good thing i can't read.;
1347225;15;14;3;aha! there you are, garfield! you're going to the vet now. - - sorry, odie. smack;
1347226;39;24;3;i wish i could find garfield's hiding place so i could take him to the vet. - he's sure hiding in a good place. - a good place-- not a smart place-- but a good place.;
1347227;46;38;6;i can't believe my luck. this is too perfect. - i will now slide down this banister and make a four-point landing on odie down there. - banzai! - - rats! - i can see the headline now: "twist in plot fatal to local cat".;
1347228;58;40;3;wouldn't it be great if everything could talk? - i'd get out of bed and the wall would say, "good morning, jon." and the sink would say, "good morning, jon." that wouldn't be so hot. - every time a light bulb burned out, it would be like a death in the family.;
1347229;15;15;3;if people had hair all over their bodies, would they wear clothing? - - probably not.;
1347230;23;18;3;what would happen if people were cats and cats were people? - that's an easy one. - dogs would soon be extinct.;
1347231;19;16;3;i was wondering, garfield... - what if being fat were considered attractive? - what do you mean, "what if," bozo?;
1347232;36;31;3;i wonder what life would be like if we never had to eat. - that would take some getting used to. - for a time, mothers would fix their families three square nothings a day.;
1347233;23;19;3;what if there were never a leonardo da vinci? - that would be awful! - the da vinci kids would have been orphans.;
1347234;24;18;7;ring! - bring! smash! - ding ding ding ding - stomp! stomp! stomp! - gasp! cough wheezeeee - shoop! - rats! too late! now i'm wide awake.;
1347236;33;23;3;i hate mondays. - this is your conscience speaking. it's not nice to hate mondays. look at it as starting a fresh week with a clean slate. - i hate mondays.;
1347237;34;29;3;this is your conscience speaking. don't you dare push odie off the table! that would be inhumane and cruel. - then you push him off. poke! - that was kind of fun.;
1347238;46;30;3;why do you follow me around, conscience? if i don't you won't be very nice. - if i put this cork in your bottle would you be trapped? yes, but that wouldn't be very nice. - that wasn't very nice.;
1347239;50;45;3;now that my conscience is trapped in this bottle, i can walk away and enjoy myself. - that's okay, go ahead, have fun, don't worry about me. i'll just sit here in the dark...all alone. - you're very good. one of the best.;
1347240;25;24;3;let's have some fun, garfield. take one step back. okay. - - i thought consciences were supposed to be nice! i'm on break.;
1347241;19;18;3;i have my conscience trapped in this bottle. i'll just set it by jon. - - get a haircut.;
1347242;88;62;8;tappity tappity tappity - good evening, ladies and germs. in our audience tonight is a boy scout delegation from booga-booga. welcome, guys. - i'm dedicating my first song to you. appropriately enough it's called, "i'm just a boy scouting for the key to your heart". - hey! - all right, you booga-booga boobs! - if you're going to throw anything, throw money, okay? ...okay. - clobber - silly me, i forgot the only currency in booga-booga is 800-pound chariot wheels.;
1347243;25;19;3;what a glorious morning! - i could really enjoy a morning like this. - if i could only get this catch out of my back.;
1347244;23;22;3;i gotta get help for this catch in my back. - hey, guys. - what we have here is a failure to communicate.;
1347245;20;19;3;maybe a good night's sleep will help me get rid of this catch in my back. - - maybe not.;
1347336;34;23;3;i hate having a catch in my back. i get no sleep, i get no food, i get no exercise. - - don't tip the cat over, odie. i get no respect.;
1347337;30;28;3;well hello there, mr. stuck-up. - having a catch in one's back does tend to give one an air of sophistication... - i could get to like this.;
1347338;22;22;3;let's take care of that catch in your back, garfield. - crink! - there you go, old buddy. thanks, i think.;
1347339;56;40;7;hey, look! odie! - it snowed last night! - ha ha, so you boys want to play in the snow, huh? - first you'll have to wear your nice, warm pet sweaters. - and your wool caps and mittens and mufflers and booties. - there you go, boys. - having fun yet? ha ha ha, wheee.;
1347340;14;13;3;who's that painting at my door? - honk honk - oh, good morning, odie. honk;
1347341;19;17;3;yawn - gasp! - waking up to my own bad breath is bad enough, but someone else's is unbearable.;
1347342;28;15;3;i am proud to be a pet. pets lend a touch of elegance to a home. slup slup - - i am proud to be a cat. slup slup;
1347343;16;16;3;okay, get revved up there, odie. - go! - i love toys that don't need batteries.;
1347344;13;13;2;- crinkle - may i have some of that candy bar? here, take it.;
1347346;29;26;2;- i declare this steak the sovereign property of garfield, the cat! - i've never had my dinner annexed before. and you may never see it alive again.;
1347347;38;23;6;- smack let's play! - leave me alone, garfield. let's play! let's play! - oh, okay, we'll play. - tickle! tickle! tickle! tickle! ha! ha! hee! ho! hee! hee! - ouch! - i'm through playing now.;
1347348;47;37;3;hey, garfield, we're going to the farm to visit dad and mom this week. - goodo. i need a change of surroundings. i was getting bored with this city life. - it will be nice to be bored in the country for a change.;
1347349;31;20;3;it's great to be back on the farm, garfield. nothing ever changes. - the same old surroundings, the same old room... - the same old chores. the same old manure.;
1347350;30;27;3;this pastoral scene is not exactly intellectually stimulating. - read any good books lately? oink. - "oink," he says. i rest my case. "oink" in the existential sense, of course.;
1347351;71;52;3;doc, do you ever regret that you stayed on the farm while i went to the city to live in the lap of luxury? - not really. dad will probably will the farm to me, and i'll sell the acreage at a huge profit and retire while young. - need a hired hand? give me a resume and three good references. and mom doesn't count.;
1347352;38;36;3;beautiful sunset, isn't it, dad? purtyer than a little red wagon goin' up a hill. - what does that mean? - oh, it's just something you city boys expect us farmers to say. how true.;
1347353;26;23;3;garfield and i must be leaving now, mom. stay, stay! i just baked some pies. - we gotta go. come on, garfield. - say what, stranger?;
1347354;50;37;5;whew! - today i am going to cure garfield of his gluttony. - go to it, boy! - he's either going to get sick eating all that food, or he's going to burst trying. munch smack slurp - are you going to want the rest of that hamburger?;

1347358;20;20;3;shoo! - flies and i have a lot in common... - you can't keep either of us away from food.;
1347359;14;13;3;i gotta beat that fly to my food! - i win! - you lose, fella. poo;
1347360;2;2;2;- whew - boo!;

1347368;17;7;3;i need a brain for my master. - - a brain, i need a brain for my master.;
1347369;14;13;3;ah, coffee. - - being a hunchback is going to take some getting used to.;
1347457;44;31;7;this is it, boys. - tonight we find out who the phantom ripper is. - he's stepping out the shadows now. - oh, no! it's...it's you! ayieee! - good movie. click - who was he? - we thought you were watching. smack grrrrr;

1347461;37;34;3;there must be clue to pooky's disappearance here somewhere... - aha! could this be a telltale trail of teddy bear hair? - even if it isn't, that was a pretty nifty bit of alliteration.;
1347462;19;18;2;hello, what's this? just as my teddy bear disappears, this sack mysteriously appears... - something smells fishy here. -;
1347463;49;41;3;aha! jon! it was you who kidnapped pooky! - obviously, sensing i was hot on his trail and fearing my wrath, he's decided to return pooky and throw himself on the mercy of the court. - i had your teddy bear cleaned, garfield. sigh...thank you.;

1347713;28;26;3;how would you like your bacon prepared, garfield? let's shoot for recognizable. - jon is a terrible cook. he could ruin cereal. - bacon flambe, yum yum.;
1347714;26;23;3;an interesting thing about food... - one minute it may be haute cuisine. - but the instant you put it into the sink, it becomes garbage.;
1347715;25;23;3;here's your cereal, garfield. - what's the matter? aren't you hungry? not really. - i think one of the flakes just moved.;
1347716;58;42;6;- i'm going to kick odie off this table. - and he'll probably sprain something and have to go to the vet. - and i'll get lonely without him. - and jon will be angry without me. - and the humane society will want to lynch me. - but nobody said life was a rose garden.;
1347717;58;42;3;i can't believe i turn six years old tomorrow. some cats say, "life begins at six," but i don't buy that. - old age may take its toll on some cats, but it's not going to happen to me! i'm going to do something about it! - right after my nap.;
1347718;35;31;3;happy birthday, garfield! i got you a rubber chicken. they're lots of fun! we'll see about that. - smack splut - chicken, you and i are going to have some good times.;
1347720;18;15;3;you need a name, fella. let's see...what do you name a rubber chicken? - rrrrr - "stretch"!;
1347721;24;19;3;peck peck peck - smack! - i'll have some ham and eggs, and my friend, stretch, will have a bowl of rubber bands.;
1347722;27;23;3;peck peck peck - stop pecking me with that rubber chicken! - aw, look, you just hurt stretch's feelings. he brings out the worst in me.;
1347723;40;34;3;pooky, i would like you to meet stretch, my rubber chicken. - quite frankly, pooky and stretch don't have a lot of personality. - but you have to trade off something when you surround yourself with good listeners.;
1347724;132;86;6;- yawn it's bed-bye time again. - tonight i think i'll take a deep breath, slowly close my eyes and savor the heavy feeling of sleep gradually overtaking my body. pat! pat! pat! - then again it would be fun to have a cup of coffee and toss and turn for a couple of hours, then sleep till noon. - or maybe i'll run around the block, collapse into bed exhausted and fall asleep instantly. - or i could watch the all-night movies on tv until my eyelids get so heavy i couldn't possibly hold them open any longer. - sigh...so much sleeping to do and so few nights.;
1347725;24;20;3;garfield, i think you're too mean to odie. - i never want to see you hit him again. oh, very well. - konk!;
1347726;19;17;3;i'm going to the store, garfield. if you lay a paw on odie, i'll spank you. - - boing;
1347727;24;22;3;garfield, i swear you've done everything to odie a cat could do to a dog. au contraire. - plink - never underestimate me.;
1347728;27;23;3;hey, odie! i found your nose! - let me put it on for you, pal. squik squik - very nice. i like you as a rat terrier.;
1347729;47;30;3;well, well, well. i see you're eating my food, odie. now what are going to do with you? - we are going to kick you into next week! that's what we're going to do! punt - where's odie? somewhere over saturday.;
1347731;34;30;3;lunch isn't the same without odie. he always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food. - i guess i 'll just have to make do. - blut;
1347820;68;46;6;- i believe you're gaining weight, garfield. i believe your eyeballs are shrinking. - look at that soft belly. that's just water retention. - now why do you suppose you're looking larger? an optical illusion? - the older you get', the bigger you get. bigger-boned maybe. - you're fat, garfield. i am not fat! - my center of gravity is just getting lower.;
1347821;24;19;3;i have this nagging feeling i'm forgetting something. - whump! - oh yes, i forgot i kicked odie into next week, last week.;
1347822;27;19;3;pooky loves me, i can tell. - he doesn't talk, he doesn't walk, he doesn't think. -  a little nothing goes a long way.;
1347823;39;35;3;i'm working up a routine for the fence tonight, pooky. tell me what you think of it. - i knew a teddy bear who was so ugly, even the tide wouldn't take it out. - blat!;
1347824;24;23;3;good evening, ladies and germs. i'd like you to meet pooky, my gag writer. - splat - welcome to the show biz, kid.;
1347825;18;17;2;jump through the hoop, pooky. - hey, garfield, what's happening? i'm pretending to teach pooky tricks. -;
1347826;26;19;3;butterflies are versatile. they can caress the air. - they can kiss the dew from the flowers. - and they can embed themselves in radiators. fwap!;
1347827;53;39;7;scritch scritch - i'll be darned. these labels are loose. - * - it's the old "cats get the tuna while the owner get the cat food" gag. - - surprise, garfield! i fixed us a tuna noodle casserole. - oh, well, i guess a half a surprise is better than none at all.;
1347828;24;22;3;garfield, i know you hate mondays. - but everything that could possibly happen to you has already happened. - au contraire, power failure breath.;
1347830;57;48;3;since we can't watch tv during a power failure, garfield, what say we listen to the radio? - ha ha! do i feel stupid. that's because you are stupid. click click - how about a game of cards? no, thanks. i'm just going to sit here and cry for a while.;
1347831;30;29;3;i've learned something from this power failure, garfield. - when you are deprived of your eyesight, isn't it amazing how much keener your other senses become? - huh?;
1347832;33;29;3;don't worry, garfield. the power failure may have spoiled the food in the refrigerator... - but we still have lots of canned goods. - now where's our electric opener? arrrgh!;
1347833;47;33;3;hey, garfield, as long as the power is off, we might as well go out. - i have my bowling ball. let's go bowling. - get your fingers out of my eyes and your thumb out of my mouth, and i'll consider it.;
1347834;24;20;2;- great! the power's back on! i can't think of anything worse than a power failure. - how about two power failures?;
1347835;41;39;7;z z - baboom! - shoop zoom - allright you guys, get out of here. it's only a little thunderstorm. - pets...they're just like kids. - crack kaboom! - urf! give me some room, will you? hey! your feet are cold!;
1347836;25;23;3;and now, a word from our sponsor. - hey, america. here's a cat food we bet your cat will love. - you're on.;
1347837;22;20;3;good morning, old buddy. - arrrgh! that's only a piece of lint, garfield. - it sure does a great spider impression.;
1347838;19;17;3;bark! bark! bark! - odie isn't really stupid. bonk - he's just chased one too many parked cars.;
1347839;11;11;3;okay, you turkeys, i'm prepared for anything. - * arooo * - crash!;
1347841;30;28;3;garfield, if you mess with my new fish, you'll regret it. - what's so regrettable about a little seafood snack? - jon's going to pay for this.;

1347844;23;20;3;you sleep too much, garfield. - sometimes i do feel bad about sleeping so much. - what with all the insomniacs in china.;
1347845;19;18;3;what odie needs is a good kick. - uh-oh! nap attack! - i don't even want to know. z;

1348332;44;30;3;what is love to you, garfield? love is that exhilarating feeling you get when a vision of beauty comes walking to you. - in fact, i just had that experience. when you saw me? - when i saw my mirror this morning.;
1348333;14;12;6;- - - poo! - - konk! - the harder you work for something, the more you appreciate it.;
1348334;41;29;3;garfield, there's a mouse in the house, and i'm just sick about it. - it chewed the toe out of my sock. - i want you to catch it and kill it. now i'm sick about it.;

1348426;25;18;3;we gotta give you a name, mouse. - how about crusher? how about bruiser? how about cat killer? - how about squeak? i like it.;
1348427;34;30;3;here, squeak, let me strap this key to your back. what's this for? - i don't remember buying you a toy mouse, garfield. - got the picture? you're a genius!;
1348428;97;71;5;- a dimly lit street corner at midnight. this puts me in the mood for some snappy patter. - hey, good-lookin!. what's happening? who are you? - names aren't important. some call me a soldier of fortune, some call me a renaissance man. you can call me "major". i love men in uniform. - what say we go to rick's cafe americain for a soda pop? i'm with you, big boy. - here's lookin' at you, sweetheart. smack! rats. i think i chucked her chin a little hard.;
1348429;38;28;3;hide! here comes my owner! - why are we hiding? jon wants me to eat you and i don't want to. - you're so nice! thanks for thinking of me. i was thinking of me.;
1348430;68;49;3;okay, squeak, here's the game plan. every now and then, you show up in front of jon and dance around until i appear on the scene and chase you away. - in return, you get a nice home to live in, and i get to keep my job. - this is a strange world we live in. you gotta play by the rules.;
1348431;20;18;3;here's your cat food, garfield. - a mouse! - that must be the surprise at the bottom of the box.;
1348432;36;29;3;hey, squeak, i found a great place for you to live! - jon will never think to look for you in this old log cabin. - nice, huh? is it in a good school system?;
1348433;24;23;1;thanks for the house, garfield. a man needs a place to call his own. this is great! don't mention it, kid. - -;
1348435;36;30;3;listen carefully, squeak. this is a mousetrap. never, never touch the tab in the center of it. - you mean, this little tab here? - this boy does not take direction well. hey! that hurt!;

1348438;42;35;3;oh no! a flea! i'm getting you a flea collar, garfield. let's not be too hasty here. - look at those distinctive yellow and green markings there. - this flea is a member of a rare species of vegetarians.;
1348439;35;28;3;well, there's your new flea collar, garfield. - wait a minute, there's a disclaimer on this box. "warning: while this collar will repel fleas..." - "it has been known to attract sharks.";
1348440;12;12;1;don't take that flea collar off, garfield! who needs it? - -;
1348441;18;16;2;you have a pretty grim flea problem there, odie. - that's not a very strong flea collar. -;
1348442;30;27;3;did i ever tell you about my crazy uncle berle? he thought he was a dog. - the poor guy was always exhausted. - he kept chasing himself up trees.;
1348443;60;47;7;can we talk? - i would like to speak to you about how wonderful cats are. - unlike dogs, they always land on their feet. - they are more calm than dogs. rowr! - every movement is a deliberate statement of grace and beauty. - and when it comes to coordination, they are far superior to dogs. whap! - bark ! bark!;
1348444;41;36;3;doc boy! how's my favorite little brother? - oh, things are pretty much the same here, wild parties, good times, the usual... - uh, you say you're coming to visit? it's put up or shut up time.;
1348446;62;47;3;what am i going to do, garfield? my brother is coming to visit from the farm. - he thinks i live life in the fast lane. "life in the parking lot" is more like it. - i don't know where he got the idea. it was when you told him you were negotiating movie rights to your diary.;

1348449;56;45;3;oh, by the way, doc boy, i've fixed us up on a double date. hey, great! - what's a double date? that's when you and i go on a date together. - gee, it seems like it would be more fun if some girls came along. there's no hope.;

1391019;14;11;3;pooky! - how dare you harm my teddy bear! pop - bap bap bap bap bap;
1391020;33;26;7;yawn - all right! snow! - i love the first snow of the year. - whoaaa! - fump! - blat! splat! bop! - did you enjoy the snow, garfield? quite...i'm ready for summer snow.;
1391021;37;34;3;attention, lounge lizards! this is your week in the sun. today we begin celebrating "national lazy week"! - what's so great about being lazy, you say? - what if war were declared and nobody showed?;
1391022;38;29;3;is national lazy week for you? ask yourself this: - would you be willing to lead a parade in celebration of the lazy life? - if the answer is yes...you're all wrong for lazy week.;
1391023;34;19;3;never confuse being lazy with being apathetic. we lazy people are not apathetic. - apathetic people don't care about anything. - lazy people care, we just don't do anything about it.;
1391024;58;39;3;do people call you "worthless"? do people call you a "couch potato"? - why should we be held up to public ridicule just because we subscribe to a kinetically passive lifestyle. we should stand up for ourselves! - the next time people call you lazy, tell 'em you were sick when you were a kid!;
1391025;42;39;3;don't forget the national lazy week motto, lazy people. "there must be an easier way". - many great ideas have been spawned from that noble sentiment. - you can bet it wasn't an exercise freak who invented power steering.;
1391027;59;49;3;for those of you who want to stop abusing your bodies through fanatic exercise, but can't muster the willpower... - you can now join "garfield's exercisers anonymous". - every time you feel an uncontrollable urge to jog, i send someone over with a mug of warm milk and a tape of the beverly hillbillies.;
1391028;58;50;8;waterin' down the coffee again, pilgrim? - burp - - jon! - jon! wake up! i'm having nightmares! - garfield, if you didn't stuff yourself right before going to bed, you wouldn't dream about big, ugly monsters. - did you hear what he called you guys? - i think i'll polish off that pepperoni pizza now.;
1391029;30;27;3;isn't this great, garfield? we have a whole day of fishing ahead of us! hotcha. - hey! where's the bait? bait? - garfield! i thought it was sushi.;
1391030;29;28;3;actually, garfield is pretty easy to care for. - cats are so clean, always primping and washing themselves. - we're out of foot powder. almost to a fault.;
1391031;33;29;3;ah, my dear, you're as lovely as ever, but, you look so stiff and formal in that outfit. - why don't you slip into something more comfortable? - like me!;
1391032;2;2;2;- chomp! - sprong!;
1391033;29;25;3;just what is an heirloom? - a heirloom is something that's been in your family for generations... - that no one's had the guts to pitch out.;

1391035;50;41;7;* oh, nermalll * - kittens love to chase things. - crash! this can be a very satisfying form of enterteinmant. - bonk! kittens also love to play catch. - but, the best way to drive them wild is to hide objects from them. - rowr! crunch! hiss! - but, not for very long.;
1391036;35;29;3;garfield! wake up! - i've made a decision that could alter the course of my entire life. - i have decided to grow a mustache. i suppose i could blame this on monday.;
1391038;51;46;3;notice anything different about me, garfield? you're not drinking out of your binky the clown mug. - i think my mustache is coming in rather nicely. that's not your cocoa? - wanna touch it? it feels really weird. hey, buddy, i have to eat with these hands!;
1391039;34;31;3;look odie! a hideous hairy monster is nesting under jon's nose! - maybe it'sll spread and cover the rest of his face. - are you making fun of me? it moved!;
1391040;36;29;3;mustaches do strange things to people. - they make some guys think they're someone they're not. - frankly, my dear, i don't give a darn. i don't feel safe here anymore.;
1391041;22;20;3;arrrgh! - jon! what happened? i'm fine! go away! - are you okay? tell me! the shaver snagged my mustache, okay?;
1391042;35;29;3;i shaved my mustache off, garfield. do tell. - i decided it made me look like a walrus. i'm proud of you, jon. - it takes a big walrus to admit his mistakes.;

1391046;41;35;3;here i am falling asleep face down in a bowl of food. - this is it. i've reached the pinnacle of laziness and gluttony...how depressing. - there's no place to go after you've reached the top.;
1391047;29;19;3;i eat too much because i'm depressed, and i'm depressed because i eat too much. - it's a vicious circle... - that took years to perfect!;
1391049;14;13;3;bang! bang! hello? anybody home? - brinnnnng! - next time, use the door knocker. sorry.;
1391050;11;11;2;- stop right there! - sometimes that's all a cat understands.;

1391143;35;31;2;look, garfield. it's pooky! your favorite possession and closest friend. do you remember pooky? - don't be silly. i'm a grown cat. what would i need with a teddy bear?;
1391144;19;16;3;amnesia has wiped my slate clean. i start establishing who i am today. - - i am (burp) a glutton.;
1391145;63;52;7;hey, stranger. this body ain't big enough for the both of us. - what a week...i fall on my head, totally lose my memory, and have no idea who this garfield fella is. - - hang on! something's coming back! - ha! ha! - wham! wham! wham! - i'm terribly sorry about that. you see, i'm not myself today.;
1391146;28;25;3;amnesia is weird. this garfield is like a total stranger to me. - i know nothing about him. - aside from what the creep did to my body.;

1391150;11;11;3;let's test his reflexes. donk! - - doing! normal. for garfield.;
1391151;38;36;3;perhaps garfield's amnesia could be cured by lightly traumatizing his cranium. - knock my cat on the head?! who would ever do such a thing?!! - may i be of assistance? you stay out of this.;
