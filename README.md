<h1>Information Retrieval System </h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
This repository contains an Information Rettrieval System developed for a work assignment at the University of Pavia for the Information Retrieval Class by prof. Luigi Santagelo.
I will use the dataset created by github user EnricoBenedetti in his repository GarfieldRetrieve. In which he goes beyond and performs statistical studies on the dataset. 

Plans:
    - I plan for at least a boolean retrieval system
    - The main aspect will be to search comics through text but additionally through text on 
        - Time period
        - By specific vignette text


Additional Comment: This is my first time using java so I do expect this project to not be on the same level as other IRS, however I see it as a great opportunity to inmerse myself in the language.
